I read numerous books and spent much effort on stuffs related to programme, multimedia, webpage and mobile application design. I am an experienced programmer. Since I was a secondary 1 student, I was fascinated by all these computer things. Now, I am working in a start-up company as a part-time programmer and always lead the team to move forward.</p><p>My faith in life is “Walking the walk, instead of talking the talk”. For me, talking is always slower than working.</p></div></section>
